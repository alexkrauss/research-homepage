I am a former member of the [Theorem Proving Group](https://www21.in.tum.de), headed by [Tobias Nipkow](https://www21.in.tum.de/~nipkow).
In my dissertation I developed a defininition mechanism for recursive functions in the theorem prover [Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/),
and methods to prove termination of such functions automatically.

I left TUM in August 2011, and now work as a Principal Software Architect at [QAware GmbH](https://www.qaware.de/), designing
and building complex business software.

Currently (April - September 2019), I am spending a research sabbatical at TUM. I am working to develop a soft type system on top
of a set-theoretic logic.
