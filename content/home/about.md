I am a former member of the [Theorem Proving Group](https://www21.in.tum.de), headed by [Tobias Nipkow](https://www21.in.tum.de/~nipkow).
In my dissertation I developed a defininition mechanism for recursive functions in the theorem prover [Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/),
and methods to prove termination of such functions automatically.

I left TUM in August 2011, and now work as a Principal Software Architect at [QAware GmbH](https://www.qaware.de/), designing
and building complex business software.

In April 2019, I will be back at TUM for six months for a research sabbatical, where I plan on working with Isabelle/ZF.
