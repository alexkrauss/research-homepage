# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "In order to make existing formalizations available for set-theoretic developments, we present an automated translation of theories from Isabelle/HOL to Isabelle/ZF. This covers all fundamental primitives, particularly type classes. The translation produces LCF-style theorems that are checked by Isabelle's inference kernel. Type checking is replaced by explicit reasoning about set membership."
