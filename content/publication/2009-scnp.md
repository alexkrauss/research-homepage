# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Ben-Amram and Codish described SCNP, a subclass of the size-change termination criterion SCT, which permits efficient certificate checking. Termination problems in this class have a global ranking function of a certain form, which can be found using SAT solving. This note describes an automated proof reconstruction for this certificate scheme, implemented in the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL."
